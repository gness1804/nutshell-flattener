##Nutshell Flattener Challenge

This is an array flattening function. When one inputs any array of arrays, it will flatten it into a single array. Example: `[[1,[[2]],[3]],4]` returns `[[1,[[2]],[3]],4]`.

Testing:

* To run the tests, clone down this repo, `npm install`, and then `npm run test` or `mocha`.
* The tests will run, and the results will appear in the terminal. If the install was correct and no code is altered from the repo, all four tests will pass.
* The tests cover several input cases to ensure that the function works.
